# üéµ Discord Music Bot

A powerful, feature-rich Discord music bot built with **Discord.js v14** and powered by **Lavalink**. Designed for high-quality audio playback, stability, and ease of use. This project provides a robust foundation for a personal or public music bot.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. It does not include any credentials, nor does it provide instructions on bypassing third-party services. Usage of this project with external services (e.g., YouTube, Spotify) may be subject to their Terms of Service. You are responsible for providing your own valid credentials obtained through official APIs.

This repository contains the source code for the bot itself. For the pre-configured Lavalink server used with this bot, check out the companion repository:

* **Bot Source:** [koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-bot](https://github.com/koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-bot)
* **Lavalink Server:** [koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-server](https://github.com/koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-server)

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **High-Quality Audio:** Leverages Lavalink for efficient and crystal-clear audio streaming.
* **Wide Source Support:**
  * **YouTube:** Play songs, playlists, and search directly (via OAuth credentials).
  * **Spotify:** Play songs, playlists, and albums with title matching via the Lavasrc plugin.
  * **Local Files:** Upload and play your own audio files (`.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, etc.).
* **Advanced Queue System:** View, shuffle, add, remove, and move tracks with intuitive commands.
* **Interactive Controls:** Paginated queue, interactive search results, and clear "Now Playing" messages.
* **Playback Control:** Standard commands like `play`, `pause`, `resume`, `skip`, and `stop`, plus seeking with `forward` and `rewind`.
* **Looping Modes:** Repeat a single track or the entire queue.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Smart fallbacks for local file playback and handlers for track exceptions to ensure smooth operation.
* **Clean & Modern:** Uses Discord's Slash Commands and Embeds for a seamless user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is split into two parts: the **Discord Bot** (this repository) and the **Lavalink Server**. You need both running for the bot to work.

---

### ‚ö° Option A ‚Äì Run with Docker (recommended)

1. **Install prerequisites:**  
   * **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed. If you install Docker Desktop, compose will already be included.
     - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
     - [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-bot.git
   cd discord-lavalink-music-bot
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**  
   Use `.env.example` as a reference. Copy its contents to a new file named `.env` and edit it with your credentials.

4. **Slash Commands Deployment:**
   Before using the bot for the first time (or if you updated/added a command), you must deploy its slash commands. The bot being online does not automatically register them with Discord.

   To deploy commands globally (available in all servers the bot is in):
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm bot npm run deploy
   ```

   If you ever need to remove all commands:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm bot npm run undeploy
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Global command deployment can take a few minutes to propagate across Discord. Be patient if commands don't appear instantly.

5. **Build and start the bot in the background:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

6. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

7. **Stop the bot:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

---

### ‚ö° Option B ‚Äì Run locally (manual setup)

1. **Install prerequisites:**  
   * **Node.js v18+**
   * **npm v11+**
     - [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
     - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):  
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
       sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
       npm install -g npm
       ```  
     - Linux (Fedora/CentOS/Rocky):  
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo bash -
       sudo dnf install -y nodejs
       npm install -g npm
       ```
       or
       ```bash
       curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo bash -
       sudo yum install -y nodejs
       npm install -g npm
       ```

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-bot.git
   cd discord-music
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it with your credentials.

5. **Slash Commands Deployment:**
   Before using the bot for the first time (or if you updated/added a command), you must deploy its slash commands. The bot being online does not automatically register them with Discord.

   To deploy commands globally (available in all servers the bot is in):
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   If you ever need to remove all commands:
   ```bash
   npm run undeploy
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Global command deployment can take a few minutes to propagate across Discord. Be patient if commands don't appear instantly.

6. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 2. Setting Up the Lavalink Server

For the bot to play music, it needs to connect to a Lavalink server. We provide a pre-configured, production-ready server at [koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-server](https://github.com/koureidev/discord-lavalink-music-server). Follow the instructions there to get it running.

The following environment variables need to be configured for your **Lavalink server instance**:

#### Basic Configuration

* `LAVALINK_PASSWORD`: Must match the password in the bot's `.env` file.

#### YouTube Plugin Configuration (OAuth)

For YouTube playback (youtube-plugin), you will need:

* `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`
* `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN`

#### YouTube POT Token (Optional)

This project has optional support for additional YouTube tokens. These are not officially supported by YouTube. **We do not provide instructions** for acquiring them.

If you have them, set:

* `POT_TOKEN`
* `POT_VISITOR_DATA`

#### Spotify Plugin Configuration (Lavasrc)

For Spotify link support, obtain:

* `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
* `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `SPOTIFY_COUNTRY` (your two-letter ISO country code, e.g., `US`, `JP`, `DE`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Disabling YouTube Playlist Scraping (Optional)

As mentioned in the features list, this bot uses `play-dl` as a workaround to fetch song information from YouTube playlists. This functionality is isolated and can be easily disabled if you prefer to rely solely on Lavalink's native source managers.

**Consequence:** If you disable this, commands like `/play` and `/queue add` will no longer expand YouTube playlist links into individual songs. The rest of the bot's functionality, including playing single YouTube/Spotify tracks and search, will remain unaffected.

**How to disable:**

1.  Open the command files: `commands/play.js` and `commands/queue.js`.
2.  In both files, find and remove (or comment out) the line that imports the utility:
    ```javascript
    const { fetchYouTubePlaylist } = require("../utils/playlist");
    ```
3.  In both files, find and remove (or comment out) the entire code block responsible for handling playlists. It looks like this:
    ```javascript
    // In play.js and queue.js
    if (query.includes("list=")) {
      // entire block of code
    }
    ```
4.  (Optional but recommended) You can now delete the `utils/playlist.js` file, as it will no longer be in use.
